# My dotfiles

This repository concains all my configuration files for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

## Configurations

### Zsh

Mac OS X Installation:
```sh
$ brew install zsh
```

Ubuntu Installation:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install zsh
```

### Ripgrep

I use reprep for search, it is really nice! For more information see [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

### RTags

I use [Rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags) instead of ctags it has a good integration with vim and emacs and it is really cool!
It depends on libclang-dev and llvm.

### FZF

The next nice tool that I use is [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). It helped me to use fuzzy finder in the terminal.
